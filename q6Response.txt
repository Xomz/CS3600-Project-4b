While the number of hidden layers added to the network aided the overall accuracy for each test, marginal improvements in accuracy decreased quickly after the addition of more than 5 layers. While a general trend of improved average accuracy held for virtually every data point, as well as those tests being more consistently accurate, the majority of the improvements for both data sets can be seen from 0->5 layers. In this sense, increasing the accuracy of neural networks for this data set will likely have to be weighted with the processing cost of adding more layers if more additions in hidden layers are proposed.
